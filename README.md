# ifnot
esoteric language based around the concept of if/not as a replacement for NAND as a universal operator

if all 16 logical operators can be reduced to sequences of NAND,
then it should also be true that "if" in combination with one other operator
can substitute for NAND, therefore acting as a universal operator
(crazy daydream)(formal proof forthcoming)

# idea for combining into one function

presuming the if operator can be combined with the not operator to become
entirely equivalent to the NAND operator, we can combine them into a single
operator that governs the entire language

# a Turing complete language with one operator

the basic idea here is that there is exactly one function for the entire
language and it can be used to create programs that are logically equivalent
to programs in any other Turing complete language.
