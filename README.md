# ifnot
esoteric language based around the concept of if/not as a replacement for NAND as a universal operator

if all 16 logical operators can be reduced to sequences of NAND,
then it should also be true that "if" in combination with one other operator
can substitute for NAND, therefore acting as a universal operator
(crazy daydream)(formal proof forthcoming)

# idea for combining into one function (loudercake idea)
